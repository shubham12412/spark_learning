#### Computing engine

By this, we mean that Spark handles loading data from storage systems and performing computation on it, not permanent storage as the end itself. You can use Spark with a wide variety of persistent storage systems, including cloud storage systems such as Azure Storage and Amazon S3, distributed file systems such as Apache Hadoop, key-value stores such as Apache Cassandra, and message buses such as Apache Kafka. However, Spark neither stores data long term itself, nor favors one over another. The key motivation here is that most data already resides in a mix of storage systems. Data is expensive to move so Spark focuses on performing computations over the data, no matter where it resides. In user-facing APIs, Spark works hard to make these storage systems look largely similar so that applications do not need to worry about where their data is.

***Sparkâ€™s focus on computation makes it different from earlier big data software platforms such as Apache Hadoop. Hadoop included both a storage system (the Hadoop file system, designed for low-cost storage over clusters of commodity servers) and a computing system (MapReduce), which were closely integrated together. However, this choice makes it difficult to run one of the systems without the other. More important, this choice also makes it a challenge to write applications that access data stored anywhere else.***
